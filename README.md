# Interface for the supervision and teleoperation of a mobile robot.

The goal in this project is to remotely transmit the map of the working environment of a Pioneer 3-DX, and the position of the robot on said map for its visualization in a user interface housed in a computer different from the embedded computer that the robot owns. The access to this platform is controlled through the information of a database, in such a way that it can only enter those registered in this database and in the schedule assigned to them.
